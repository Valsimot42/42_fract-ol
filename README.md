<h3><b>¤ Introduction ¤</b></h3>
<p align="center"> "fract-ol" is one of three graphical projects that we had access on this circle. As such, we have been introduced to our first graphical library "MiniLibX", which provides us with very basic functionalities. Other concepts that
we are being introduced to are the usage of complex numbers, optimization and event handling.</p>
